  <h3>Objective:</h3>

   <p>This assignment is a more advanced experience with event driven
  programing. Generally, event driven programs require the construction of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) first followed by the "glue" programming code to make the program operate. The purpose of this program will be to do chip counting for a casino, determine winnings, and calculate tax if neccessary based on the requirements described below.</p>

  <h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>
  A gambling casino in Tinian, CNMI needs a program that will help its cashiers do customer cash out transactions.  Good programmers are hard to find in the CNMI, so they have approached you. JavaScript has been chosen for the programming environment, because it can simply be placed on a web server for access. They have agreed to fly you over for an all expense paid week to observe the casino in action.  </p>
  <p>
      You enjoy your time in Tinian while doing your Problem Solving Phase "research" and begin by outlining your "Program Specs". You have agreed that you will not leave Tinian until all parties agree with your Program Specifications Report. Once the report is approved you will enter the Implementation Phase and return home to do your coding. The casino has agreed to pay you one red chip per hour until you complete the program. </p>
  <p>
  The program must satisfy the new US Federal IRS Requirement that if the gambler is a U.S. Resident, twenty percent of gambling winnings, must be withheld when cashing in chips at the cashier's window. However, CNMI residents will only have to pay five percent withholding tax and foreign residents will have no tax withheld. Additionally, the casino wants to have the chip counting automated.
 </p>
  <p>Therefore, the program must meet the following specifications:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All program code must be JavaScript embedded in a valid xhtml strict document containing a GUI form. </li>
<li>Create a GUI using XHTML forms that will allow a user to input multiple receipts for chips purchased. All receipts should be displayed in a multiline textarea.</li>
<li>Next in the form GUI the user will enter total of chips in the following denominations.
<ol type="a">
  <li>Black = $5 </li>
<li>Blue = $20</li>
<li>Red = $50 </li>
<li>Green = $100</li>
<li>Gold = $500 </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The total value of all colored chips will be calculated and displayed.
</li>
<li>The program will then subtract this amount from the total amount the gambler started with to determine the amount won.   </li>
<li>The gamblers residency status will be entered. If gambler is a U.S. Resident or CNMI resident the Social Security Number also needs to be entered.
<ol type="a"><li>CNMI Residents will have 5% withholding tax applied to the winnings. </li>
<li>Per IRS regulations, 20% will be withheld from the winnings if gambler is a US Resident  (Including Guam).  </li>
<li>Non-residents will have no tax withheld from winnings.
</li></ol> </li>
<li>The program will display in the form the winnings, tax withheld, and cash received. </li>
<li>This form will be printed as a receipt, which should be kept by the gambler for their tax records. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>No late projects will be accepted so turn in what you have before the due
  time at 6pm. Partial credit will be given for a non-working program. To
  submit your project simply login at www.islandman.org/classroom and upload
  the <em>Casino.html</em> file at the Assignment 17 link.</p>

  <p>If you wish to include images in your program or utilize an external JavaScript file then you will need to store
  a copy of all files in one zip file. You will need to use a compression
  application to create the zip file such as 7-Zip, WinZip, or WinRAR. My
  favorite is 7-Zip because it is open-source freeware, with the best
  compression ratios, and supports the most compression file types. Place all
  files in one zip file wilth the name <em>Casino.zip</em>.</p>

 <p>(Maximum File Size is 100k)</p>
