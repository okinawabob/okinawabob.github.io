  <h3>Objective:</h3>

  <p>This assignment provides an experience with a simple event driven
  program.</p>

  <h3>Requirements:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>This program will convert length measurements between inches,
    centimeters, and meters.</li>

    <li>Create a Graphical User Interface using forms elements in a valid XHTML
    document.</li>

    <li>Create JavaScript functions that will be called when specific form
    events are triggered by the user.<br></li>

    <li>Enter known test data to verify your program works correctly.<br></li>

    <li>Write a conclusion as an HTML comment at the end of the <span style=
    "font-style: italic;">Length.html</span> document which includes your name
    and your experience with the project, and known test data for each
    conversion.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>No late projects will be accepted so turn in what you have before the due
  time at 6pm. Partial credit will be given for a non-working program. To
  submit your project simply login at www.islandman.org/classroom and upload
  the Length.html file at the Assignment 16 link.</p>

  <p>If you wish to include images in your program then you will need to store
  a copy of all files in one zip file. You will need to use a compression
  application to create the zip file such as 7-Zip, WinZip, or WinRAR. My
  favorite is 7-Zip because it is open-source freeware, with the best
  compression ratios, and supports the most compression file types. Place all
  files in one zip file wilth the name <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">Length.zip</span>.</p>

  <p>(Maximum File Size is 100k)</p>
