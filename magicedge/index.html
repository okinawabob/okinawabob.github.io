        We had a major Christmas Party in 1995. Lots of toasts to our success 
        and dreams of the future. Several months later in 1996 management announced 
        the cash flow problems and asked that everyone go on half pay for a short 
        time. Three months later there was no cash for salaries, but the investors 
        were right around the corner they said. I took the summer off and returned 
        home to the shores of Lake Superior. Upon returning Chapter 7 Bankrupcy 
        was filed. My $13,000 in unpaid back salary was placed on a low priority 
        creditors list. I never did receive a dime. <BR>
