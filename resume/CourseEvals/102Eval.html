	<LI><I>Aspects of the class which you liked and those which you think need improvement:</I>
<BR>
	Class was great. I learned a lot.
<BR>
          I thoroughly enjoyed it all.
<BR>
          Great Overall Class.
<BR>
          Bob Laurie has genuine concern for his students progression.
<BR>
          Maybe some of the class time could be used in lab each day.
<BR>
          I liked the accessibility of his notes/handouts and links on his web site.<BR>
This class needs more lab time with instructor.
<BR>
          This is a beginners class. 
          A lot of students had programming before and were going
ahead which got confusing for those of us who know nothing.
<BR>
          I know time is important. Maybe early on 1/2 lecture, 1/2 lab.
<BR>
          I love your web site and email. Easy to get a hold of you. A+
PowerPoint Slides. More actual hands-on computer demos.
<BR>
          The work was challenging. More lab lectures would help.
<BR>
          Good relationships between real world and computer world.
<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
	
        <LI><I>The extent to which lecturer was responsible to the class <BR>
          (e.g. punctual, held class for full scheduled time, returned graded work promptly, made up canceled classes):</I>

<BR>
	Lecturer was great in all aspects. Also very helpful in class and made time out of class.

          Most organized teacher I have had.
<BR>
          &nbsp;
	<BR>
        <LI><I>Participation of students is an integral part of the learning process.<BR>
          Briefly comment on the student participation in this class <BR>
          (e.g. completed reading prior to class, turned in assignments on time, carried their "load" in class activities and group projects):</I>
<BR>
	Good student participation. Not all seemed willing to do everything, but ample time given.
<BR>
          Very High.
<BR>
          Good.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
          Good.
<BR>
          We had fun! Teacher made it fun for us to demonstrate before class. A+
<BR>
          Fair.
<BR>
          Class participation was very good. <BR>
          Students had some challenging questions.
<BR>
          Projects were a bit of a time crunch.
<BR>

      Other comments:
</I><BR>
          Great class very challenging.
<BR>
          Move class next to computer lab.
<BR>
          Great
<BR>
          Excellent course and instructor.<BR>
Hope UMUC leaves you in Guam another year.
<BR>
          More upper level computer classes.
<BR>
          University of Maryland should extend lab hours during the day. 
<BR>
          You should definitely take the class before any other programming class.
