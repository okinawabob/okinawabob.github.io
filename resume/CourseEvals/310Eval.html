        <LI><I>Aspects of the class which you liked and those which you think 
          need improvement:</I> <BR>
          Liked the subject matter. Disliked the book, poorly written, repetitive 
          and shallow.<BR>
          Whole class.<BR>
          I'm not she everyone agrees. However, I thought digital theory was a 
          good addition to course.<BR>
          Instructor added notes.<BR>
          I think we should have spent more time on logic gates.<BR>
          Good, No improvements. One of the best instructors I have had.<BR>
          More hands on.<BR>
          I enjoyed the book and when this instructor went over the book. I was 
          not happy with<BR>
          instructor's handouts. The referred to material that normally is considered 
          a course in it self.<BR>
          CD Rom presentation showing diagrams and pictures.<BR>
          Snooper taught me a lot about my computer. I now know what all the abbreviations 
          mean.<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
        <LI><I>The extent to which lecturer was responsible to the class <BR>
          (e.g. punctual, held class for full scheduled time, returned graded 
          work promptly, made up canceled classes):</I> <BR>
          Very Professional<BR>
          All-AOK<BR>
          Excellent<BR>
          Outstanding<BR>
          Very much followed the schedule.<BR>
          Very punctual, presented the class with a lot of material<BR>
          Good - Well prepared at all times.<BR>
          Excellent.<BR>
          Yes, he did a great job.<BR>
          Excellent on punctual and graded work returns. Did not like that he 
          held class for the <BR>
          full scheduled time. Class was never cancelled.<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
        <LI><I>Participation of students is an integral part of the learning process.<BR>
          Briefly comment on the student participation in this class <BR>
          (e.g. completed reading prior to class, turned in assignments on time, 
          carried their "load" in class activities and group projects):</I> <BR>
          Great participation- enjoyed that. Excellent Class freely participated, 
          great learning environment. Students help to educate each other. Good 
          - Always delivered good lectures, easy to understand. Lots of student 
          participation. Yes, they participated with a lot of examples. I thought 
          a couple of students slowed the progress of the class by asking too 
          many questions. <BR>
          &nbsp; <BR>
        <LI><I> Other comments: </I><BR>
          Enjoyed your class.<BR>
          Basic electronics was not needed for this course.<BR>
          Too bad he is leaving, wish he could stay.<BR>
          Bring him back.<BR>
          Do the computer program a favor and keep Bob on Guam.<BR>
          Bring this guy back to Guam.<BR>
          Good overall. Wish he could teach Visual Basic and web site design.<BR>
          I took the course to learn about computer. If I want to learn about 
          digital logic, then<BR>
          I would have taken a course on logic. Instructor spent too much time 
          on logic.<BR>
          Learned a lot from the class and the class was great.<BR>
          I came into this class not knowing anything about computers. I feel 
          I learned a lot. Thanks!
