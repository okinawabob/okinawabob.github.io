                  schadenfreude. No sooner did our dot coms implode than we 
                  Californians set to work energetically, so to speak, on the 
                  power crisis, a spectacle providing ongoing merriment for our 
                  fellow out-of-state citizens.</FONT>

      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">Does California's pitiful state seem due comeuppance for 
                  our annoying tendency to lay claim to the future first? From 
                  afar, does our deregulation mess seem comfortably distant from 
                  your own doorstep, or more precisely, from your own power

      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">Having just suffered through a temporary blackout here in 
                  Menlo Park, Calif., I am tempted to join in local demands that 
                  the thievin' power gougers be brought to swift and rough 
                  justice. Yet I confess to feeling a twinge of guilt. For I 
                  personally contribute, in sundry ways, to the mismatch between 
                  electrical power supply and demand. I believe you too, dear 
                  reader, are culpable and will eventually be affected. Not 
                  because of the regional reach of the Grid and California Gov. 
                  Gray Davis's (literal) power grab; and not because you may 
                  reside in one of the 25 other states now considering energy 
                  deregulation.</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">Rather, the California crisis is larger than it may at 
                  first appear because it exposes a universal fact that has been 
                  overlooked: On our way to the digital future, we have been 
                  enjoying a free or near-free ride, a form of transportation 
                  that, regrettably, exists only in the land of 
make-believe.</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">In the news coverage of the crisis, much attention has been 
                  devoted to prices, narrowly defined as the mismatch between 
                  the newly unregulated wholesale price of electricity and the 
                  still frozen retail price. Left ignored is other pricing that 
                  contributes to the present imbroglio: flat rates for monthly 
                  Internet access and cost-free downloading of gigabytes of 
                  data, a combination that means the household that gobbles data 
                  like a University of Nebraska lineman at the college cafeteria 
                  pays no more than the Joffrey ballerina who only nibbles.</FONT></P>

                  <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1"><B>Freeloaders.</B> The cost of maintaining reliable Web sites 
                  (reliability is referred to in the business as "high nines," 
                  as in 99.9999%) is absorbed by the site sponsors, which pay 
                  other companies to maintain "server farms." These are 
                  concentrated in Silicon Valley. A single such data center 
                  occupies the space of a modest office building but consumes 
                  the power of 10,000 single-family homes. Exodus 
                  Communications, the company that takes care of eBay and 
                  Yahoo!, among others, has six data centers in just Silicon 
                  Valley, which will soon draw an estimated 25 percent of the 
                  area's power. (Remember this is in a state that has not built 
                  a major power plant in more than a decade.)</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">Feeling virtuous because you're careful to shut down your 
                  home PC every night? It's a laudable gesture. But the desktop 
                  PC consumes only 20 percent of the power used by the Internet. 
                  Add up the costs of running the routers, caching pages, 
                  cooling the equipment, and so on, and you'll find that to 
                  create and move 2 megabytes of data over the Net is said to 
                  require the energy equivalent of 1 pound of coal.</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">The Internet, that bucket brigade transferring data around 
                  the globe, sprang up without a master plan for 
                  commercialization, and there is no simple way to make heavy 
                  users pay the true costs. The famous 1954 prediction of Lewis 
                  Strauss, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, that 
                  electrical power would be "too cheap to meter," has not come 
                  to pass. But as consumers, we can take as large a byte of the 
                  Internet's vast offerings as we wish without having to pay a 
                  charge related to the volume of data ingested. Insulated from 
                  the costs, Web surfers will naturally enough take due 
                  advantage, heedless of what economists refer to as 
                  externalities, or the costs that someone else has to pay (or 
                  an entire city of someone elses, as when the next rolling 
                  blackout instantly makes San Francisco look like Lagos).</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">Unlimited Internet access for a flat monthly rate is a 
                  luxury that Web surfers in most European countries do not 
                  enjoy. It is not directly responsible for California's energy 
                  shortage. But the mentality that it reinforces, that using 
                  technology carries no marginal cost, is plain wrong. Only five 
                  years ago, AOL still charged its members on an hourly basis. 
                  Reluctantly, the $20-a-month flat price set by independent 
                  Internet providers forced it too to move to a flat-price 
                  model. AOL then weathered an embarrassing breakdown of its 
                  dial-up systems when users gorged themselves on the unmetered 
                  service.</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">At the time of the change, AOL head Steve Case sent an 
                  E-mail asking that members "moderate" their use at peak 
                  evening times during the transition. ("Just as you would be 
                  sensitive about using a public phone booth if others were 
                  waiting in line.") In just two days, his plea drew 17,000 
                  messages from irate members, livid that he was hedging on the 
                  "unlimited use" bargain.</FONT></P>
      <P>
                    
      <P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE="-1">That, in microcosm, is the larger problem we will face as a 
                  society at some point: how to moderate use of energy-gobbling 
                  resources to which we currently have nearly unlimited access. 
                  Who would prefer the intricacies of cost accounting to the 
                  all-you-can-eat buffet? No one. That is, until the lights go 
                  out. </FONT></P>
