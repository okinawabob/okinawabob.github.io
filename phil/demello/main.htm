      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <P> I was introduced to Anthony deMello back in 1990 when I attended a contemplative 
        prayer group at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Calumet, Michigan. </P>
      <P>I was going through one of those phases in life when you wonder what 
        is the meaning of life. I had achieved most of the goals one typically 
        sets in life with education and career. I was comparitively rich as an 
        engineer, since I could make as much money as I wanted to buy things that 
        I wanted. But life seemed a bit shallow living the &quot;American Dream&quot;. 
      </P>
      <P>I thought perhaps religion might have the answers so I read many books 
        from Christianity, Buddhist, Hindu, and Cabalhistic (Jewish Mysticism) 
        faiths. I noticed many similarities but resisted being swallowed by the 
        dogma of any one faith. </P>
      <P>For me, Anthony deMello presented the best insight into happiness and 
        feeling God's presense in one's life. He grew up in India and is a Catholic 
        Jesuit Priest. He teaches in a story telling manner and yet finds the 
        common thread. </P>
      <P>This web page contains audio from his first video &quot;A&nbsp;Way&nbsp;to&nbsp;God&nbsp;for&nbsp;Today&quot;. 
        You can purchase his videos and books by following the links below. I 
        hope you will find as much inspiration in his words as I have.</P>
