<H2><B> Part 6: Love </B></H2>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>Love has two aspects: the aspect of creation and the aspect of identification. 
  Exercises are given that will help participants see the good in others and in 
  themselves. An additional exercise is given that will help participants realize 
  their oneness with other people.</P>
<H3>Love Exercise</H3>
<P>In a meditative environment think of someone you love. Imagine that person 
  is sitting in front of you. Talk to that person. Talk lovingly, describe what 
  that person means to you. As you do this, be in touch with what you are feeling. 
  (Allow five to ten minutes for this exercise.)</P>
<H5>Discussion Questions</H5>
<OL>
  <LI>Why is love closely related to spiritual growth? Why is love so incomprehensible? 
    What is your understanding of love?</LI>
  <LI>Fr. de Mello said, &quot;Love is something that is so vast that it is almost 
    like God himself.&quot; Explain what this statement means to you.</LI>
  <LI>What is meant by the aspect of love as creation? What did the story of the 
    eagle and the chickens teach you about this aspect of love?</LI>
  <LI>How can to you give those close to you the consciousness of who they truly 
    are? How can you give you them wings?</LI>
  <LI>Do you think there is such a thing as a bad boy or a bad girl? Why or why

    the story about the &quot;spurters&quot; teach you about this?</LI>
  <LI>What was Father Flanagan’s secret with the kids at Boys Town? How might 
    you put his secret to use with someone you know?</LI>
  <LI>Psychologists say people tend to become what they feel they are. Do you 
    think this is true? If so, do you think this is a spiritual truth? Why? How 
    can you use this for the good of others?</LI>
  <LI>If Jesus returned to earth, what do you think would be the first thing he 
    would notice in humanity?</LI>
  <LI>Why do you think good people tend to see the good in others and evil people 
    tend to see the evil? Do people tend to see in others a reflection of them-selves? 
    If so, why?</LI>
  <LI>How can the exercises de-scribed in this program make you a more loving 
    person? Which of the exercises do you think will be the most effective for

    What was the effect of this on those people?</LI>

    us? What person in your life has done the most for you by seeing the good 
    in you? Recall this story and share it.</LI>
  <LI>If Jesus came back to earth today and wanted to stay at your house tonight, 
    how would he treat you? What would he think of you? What good would he see 
    in you?</LI>
  <LI>What is love as identification? Who is the holy person? What are the characteristics 
    of the holy person?</LI>
  <LI>How can you attain the kind of love that is the mark of the holy person?</LI>
  <LI>In what ways are you and those around you not two and yet not one? What 
    do you and those around you have in common? What separates you from them? 
    How are all Christians one in the body of Christ?</LI>
  <LI>What can you do to gain the aspect of love as identification? Why is this 
    kind of love a grace? What can you do to prepare for this grace?</LI>

    describe him?</LI>

<H3>Exercises for Creative Love </H3>
<H4>Talk to Someone You Like</H4>
<P>In a meditative environment think of someone you love. Imagine that person 
  is sitting in front of you. Talk to that person. Talk lovingly, describing what 
  that person means to you. As you do this, be in touch with what you are feeling.</P>
<H4>Talk to Someone You Do Not Like</H4>
<P>In the same manner as above think of someone you don’t particularly like. Imagine 
  that person is in front of you. As you look at that person, try to see something 
  good in him or her.</P>
<H4>See Jesus Look at This Person</H4>
<P>Imagine Jesus is standing be-side you and he is looking at that person that 
  you do not like.</P>
<P>Jesus becomes your teacher in the art of love. What good and what beauty would 
  Jesus detect in that person? Say what Jesus would say to that person.</P>
<H4>See Jesus Look at You</H4>
<P>Imagine you have Jesus in front of you and he tells you all the goodness, the 
  beauty, and all the lovely qualities he sees in you. Don’t shirk this exercise. 
  Jesus makes allowances for defects and will see through them to your goodness. 
  What name or names do you think Jesus would make up for you?</P>
<H4>Look and Listen</H4>
<P>Repeat the first looking exercise of these programs. That is, look at some 
  scene or some object without thinking about it. Don’t look for anything sensational. 
  Just look and listen and touch with a quiet mind.</P>
