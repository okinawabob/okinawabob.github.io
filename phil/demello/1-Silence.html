<H2>Part 1: Silence </H2>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>Anyone who wants to find God must pass through silence. The three ways of gaining 
  silence are: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>By understanding the limitations of our words and ideas, </LI>
  <LI>By truly looking, listening, and hearing without preconceived images, ideas, 
    or reactions, and </LI>
  <LI>By meditatively reading the scriptures. Illustrations and examples of each 
    of these are given throughout the program.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Silence Exercise</H3>
<P>Recall your favorite sentence of Jesus from the New Testament. Repeat it to 
  yourself. Imagine Jesus is standing in front of you and is addressing those 
  words to you. Don’t dwell too much on the meaning of the words. Resist the temptation 
  to react. Don’t say anything and don’t respond in any way. Let the words reverberate 
  in your heart and resound in your being. When you cannot contain it anymore, 
  respond to Jesus. (Allow five to ten minutes for this exercise.)</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Fr. de Mello said, "Any way to God has to be a way through silence. If you 
    ever come to union with God, you must pass through silence." Do you agree? 
    Has Fr. de Hello interested you in silence? Have you ever practiced silence 
    in the past? If so, how? How does Fr. de Mello’s ideas about silence differ 
    from what you had previously thought of silence? How will you practice silence 
    differently as a result of this program?</LI>
  <LI>To illustrate what silence is Fr. de Hello told a story about a king who, 
    wanting to know how to be united with God, visited a spiritual master. The 
    master said the only way was through silence. The king asked, "How is silence 
    gained?" The master responded, "By meditation." The king asked, "What is meditation?" 
    The master responded, "Silence." What do you think is the point of this story? 
    What was the master trying to tell the king?</LI>
  <LI>Fr. de Mello said that to gain silence you must understand that God is far 
    beyond all your words and all your thoughts. Do you agree? If so, how should 
    you come to know God? What are the limitations of words and ideas? </LI>
  <LI>As a child, what images did you have of God? How have those images changed? 
    What is your image of God now? Do you think this image helps your spiritual 
    growth? Why or why not?</LI>
  <LI>In the Second Lateran Council it was said that any image of God we have 
    is more unlike him than like him. What do you think this means?</LI>
  <LI>How does scripture help you to know God, even though it cannot give you 
    a picture of God?</LI>
  <LI>Why is God indescribable?</LI>
  <LI>Fr. de Mello said that the second thing you need in order to gain silence 
    is to look and listen. What was his point? How can you do this? How do you 
    need to look and listen differently than you do now?</LI>
  <LI>In the East they say, "God created the world. God dances the world." What 
    do you think "God dances the world" means? How might it be possible that we 
    see the dance but not the dancer? What is the difference? How are the dance 
    and the dancer not one thing and yet not two?</LI>

<H3><B> Exercises for Silence </B></H3>
<H4>Understand</H4>
<P>Come to the realization that words and ideas are inadequate. Meditate on this. 
  Recall each idea you have of God and say to yourself, "He is more unlike this 
  than like it. He is far beyond this and far better than this."</P>
<H4>Look</H4>
<P>Look at some nature scene or some object. Don’t look for anything sensational. 
  Just look as if you are seeing it for the first time.</P>
<H4>Listen</H4>
<P>Listen to all the sounds around you. If possible, avoid putting names to the 
  sounds. Realize that each sound is really composed of many sounds. Don’t look 
  for anything sensational. Just listen to those sounds as if you are hearing 
  them for the first time in your life.</P>
<H4>Scripture</H4>
<P>Recall your favorite sentence of Jesus from the New Testament. Repeat it to 
  yourself. Imagine Jesus is standing in front of you and he addresses those words 
  to you. Don’t dwell too much on the meaning of the words. Resist the temptation 
  to react. Don’t say anything and don’t respond in any way. Let the words reverberate 
  and resound within you. When you cannot contain it anymore, respond to Jesus.</P>
<P>A variation of this exercise is to get into silence first. Then recall a sentence 
  from scripture or get someone to read it to you. Those words of scripture will 
  be etched in your heart and they will deepen your silence. They may take on 
  a meaning that is quite beyond the power of words to express.</P>
