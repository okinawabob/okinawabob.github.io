      Body-Awareness Exercise
    </h3>
    <p>
      Close your eyes. Get in touch with your body. Get the feel of the clothes
      on your shoulders. What do they feel like? Get the feel of the clothes on
      your back. Get the feel of your thighs pressing against the chair. Get
      the feel of your hands as they touch something or rest on something. Get
      the feel of your feet touching your shoes or the floor.

      Repeat the exercise five or six times and then open your eyes. If you
      feel tension, get in touch with it. Become aware of its location and
      component parts and you will become relaxed. (Allow five to ten minutes
      for this exercise.)

    <h3>
      Discussion Questions
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In this program Fr. deMello talked about spiritual peace. Have you
      experienced this kind of peace? If so, what were the circumstances? How
      has this program changed your ideas about peace? Do you think spiritual
      peace is important? Why or why not? How do you spread peace?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. deMello remarked that the kind of peace he described may not
      exclude fighting. How is this possible? What example can you think of in
      which peace and conflict were both present?
      </li>
      <li>Fr, deMello said the only thing peace excludes is a self-centered
      attitude. Do you agree? How does selfishness lead to the absence of
      peace?
      </li>
      <li>What is soft-heartedness as described by Fr. deMello? What acts of
      soft-heartedness can you think of? Did these acts promote peace? If so.
      how?
      </li>
      <li>Can you say there is no rancor, no bitterness, and no
      hatred in your life? If not, where are these present? How can you
      do away with them?
      </li>
      <li>Is there turmoil and conflict in your heart? Why?
      What can you do to lessen them?
      </li>
      <li>Did you do the body-awareness exercise as it was described in the program? If so, did it make you feel relaxed? How?
      </li>
      <li>In one of the stories t o l d i n
t h i s program, God's most t r u s t e d
angels advised him to hide i n the
human h e a r t because no one would
think of searching f o r him there.
What e f f e c t did t h i s s t o r y have
on you? Do you think of God as
being i n the human heart? What
does t h i s mean to you?</li>
<li>Fr. de Mello a s s e r t e d t h a t h i s
body-awareness e x e r c i s e w i l l help
you come home t o y o u r s e l f . What
is your r e a c t i o n to t h a t ? W i l l
you t r y it r e g u l a r l y ? Do you
think it can help you? Why or
why not?</li>
<li>Fr. de Mello said it is an
e x t r a o r d i n a r y t h i n g to come to
t h e present. Why is it extraordinary?
Do you consider yours
e l f present i n the way t h a t Fr.
de Mello described i t ? Explain,
using examples.</li>
<li>What is t h e value o f slowing
down? When is slowing down necess
a r i l y opposed to speed?
e</li>
<li>k What is the value of doing
one thing a t a time? Do you do
one thing a t a t i m e always, somet
i m e s , or never? Explain.</li>
<li>How do you think the exercises
described i n t h i s program
lead to union with God?</li>
<li>The awareness exercises w i l l
give you an a t t i t u d e o f accept-
_ ance. What. was the l a s t Wing you
peacefully accepted? Do you t r y
to f i g h t the things you cannot
change? I f SO, how? What is the
e f f e c t of t h i s f i g h t i n g ?</li>
<li>Fr. de Mello said t h a t the
goal of the awareness e x e r c i s e s
is to a t t a i n the a t t i t u d e of acceptance
and y e t to be i n t e n s e l y
involved. Do you think you can
achieve t h i s a t t i t u d e ? To what
important things i n your l i f e
would you l i k e to apply t h i s
a t t i t u d e ?</li>
<li>When J e s u s d i e d he s a i d , "My
peace be with you." What is the
peace t h a t Jesus l e f t with us?
How w i l l the e x e r c i s e s i n t h i s
program help you gain t h a t peace?</li>
<li>Which of the e x e r c i s e s described
i n t h i s program did you
find most i n t e r e s t i n g ? Which w i l l
you t r y on a r e g u l a r b a s i s ? What
do you hope t o gain from these
e x e r c i s e s ?</li>

      Wrong attitudes are the attitudes of the sulking child and the clinging
      child. Exercises are described that will help people get rid of wrong
      ideas and attitudes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Joy Exercise (The Koan)
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a meditative environment ask yourself, "What would happen if I let my
      clinging, negative emotions go? What would happen if I let go of my
      guilt, my heartbreak, my jealousy, my resentment?" Stay with this
      question as long as you can and see what you will discover. (Allow five
      to ten minutes for this exercise.)
    </p>
    <h5>
      Discussion Questions
    </h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Is the topic of joy important for spiritual growth? What is joy? In
      what things do you find the most joy? Could you be happy without these
      things? Why or why not?
      </li>
      <li>The Indian poet Kabir wrote, "I laughed when they told me the fish in
      the water is thirsty." What does this mean to you? How does this relate
      to this program?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. de Mello commented, "The whole of creation is shot through with
      joy." What do you think he meant by this statement?
      </li>
      <li>Why, in your opinion, does humanity often have so little joy?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. de Mello said that humanity is often without joy because of wrong
      ideas and wrong attitudes. What ideas and attitudes cause <u>you</u> to
      be without joy?
      </li>
      <li>For true joy, Fr. de Mello asserted, you must get rid of the notion
      that happiness comes from being on a high from outer stimulation or
      intoxication. Have these ways of "having fun" ever left you depressed? If
      so, recall an example. What do you think is missing from these
      activities? Where does true joy come from?
      </li>
      <li>In the program it was said, "The thing to get intoxicated on is life.
      It�s a much quieter thing, but much more lasting." How do you get
      intoxicated on life? Have you ever had such an experience? If so, what
      was it?
      </li>
      <li>One of the wrong ideas described by Fr. de Mello during the program
      was the idea that we can chase after happiness. How has chasing after
      happiness disappointed you before?
      </li>
      <li>In the program Fr. de Mello asserted, "Happiness is the offshoot of
      something else." What is that something else? What have you done that you
      realized later made you happy?
      </li>
      <li>It has been said, "Happiness is really a memory. It is barely an
      experience." What does this mean to you? Do you agree with it? If so,
      give examples. Do you think sadness might also really be a memory?
      </li>
      <li>Happiness is not found in externals. What external things do you
      depend on now for happiness? What things do you wish for to make you more
      happy? Has this program changed your ideas about these things? If so,
      how? What is necessary internally for happiness?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. de Mello told several stories of prisoners who were in miserable
      conditions and yet who were happy. Do you know of other true stories that
      are similar? What are they? What do these stories teach about joy and
      happiness?
      </li>
      <li>What is the attitude of the sulking child? Examine yourself. Do you
      have this attitude about something that is making you unhappy? How can
      you get rid of this attitude? Will a sulking child ever be satisfied?
      </li>
      <li>What one thing would you ask for to make you always happy?
      </li>
      <li>In a story told during this program God advises a man to ask to be
      happy no matter what he gets in life. Do you think this is possible for
      you? What comes in the way of your having this grace?
      </li>
      <li>What is the clinging child attitude? What are <u>you</u> clinging to?
      What negative emotion are you unable to let go of? Explore the
      possibility that you are unable because you are unwilling. What can you
      discover about yourself?
      </li>
      <li>"There is no sweeter prayer on earth than a grateful heart." How will
      the exercises described in this program lead you to a grateful heart? Can
      you think of other similar exercises with the same goal?
      </li>
      <li>Do you consider the exercises described in this program to be prayer
      exercises? Why or why not? What did Fr. de Mello have to say about
      this?<br />

      <b>Exercises for Joy</b>
    </h3>
    <h4>
      The Koan
    </h4>
    <p>
      In a meditative environment ask yourself, "What would happen if I let go
      of my clinging and negative emotions? What would happen if I let go of my
      guilt, my heartbreak, my jealousy, my resentment?" Stay with this
      question as long as you can and see what you will discover.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Awareness: Looking, Hearing, Sensing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Look at some nature scene or some object. Don�t look for anything
      sensational. Just look as if you are seeing it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to all the sounds around you. If possible, avoid putting names to
      the sounds. Realize that each sound is really composed of many sounds.
      Don�t look for anything sensational. Just listen to those sounds as if
      you are hearing them for the first time in your life.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Exclamation
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is impossible to be grateful and unhappy. In a meditative environment
      say to yourself repeatedly, "How lucky I am. How grateful I am." As you
      repeat these words recall some of your life�s blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go over all the events that happened yesterday. Be grateful for all these
      events. Say, "Thank you. How lucky I was that that happened to me." When
      you come to an unpleasant event, consider the seeds for growth that it
      contains and be grateful.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Identification
    </h4>
    <p>
      Put yourself in the place of the paralyzed woman who was described on the
      program. Lie on your back and say, "I can do all the loveliest things in
      the world. I can have all the loveliest things in the world." Find out
      what these loveliest things are. If you discover them, you will find
      gratitude and you will find abiding joy.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The Blessing
    </h4>
    <p>
      Recall the words of Juliana of Norwich, "And all shall be well. And all
      shall be well. And all manner of things shall be well." Think of pleasant
      and unpleasant events of the past. At each event say, "It was well. It
      was well." Think of some present things, things that are happening to you
      now. Say, "It is well. It is well." Think of something coming in the
      future. Say, "It will be well. It will be well." Your faith will be
      changed into joy.
