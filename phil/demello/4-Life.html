  program.</P>
<H3>Life Exercise</H3>
<P>Think of an event in the recent past. Observe yourself reacting to this event. 
  How did you react emotionally? What convictions and attitudes were part of your 
  reaction? What inner voice were you responding to? Was someone else reacting 
  for you? Be a neutral observer. Do not judge yourself. Just look. Take your 
  time with this exercise. (Allow at least ten minutes for this exercise.)</P>
<H5>Discussion Questions</H5>
<OL>
  <LI>Why do so few people take the time to improve the spiritual quality of their 
    lives? What is the single most important thing you can do to improve the quality 
    of your life? What has this program taught you about this?</LI>
  <LI>What does it mean to say someone has died without ever having lived? How 
    can a person be neither dead nor alive? Do you think you are one of these 
    people? Why or why not?</LI>
  <LI>Being alive means (a) to be you, (b) to be now, and (c) to be here. Explain 
    what each of these means, using examples.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;In the measure that you are you, you are alive.&quot; Explain this; 
    statement and then briefly de-scribe yourself.</LI>
  <LI>Who might you be besides your-self? Are you subject to remote control? Who 
    has been the greatest influence on you in the past? Who is the greatest influence 
    on you now? Are these influences on you good or bad?</LI>
  <LI>Are you controlled by voices from the past? If so, whose voices are they?</LI>
  <LI>What do you think Jesus meant when he said you must hate your mother and 
    father? What did Fr. de Mello say about this?</LI>
  <LI>How can you drop the mechanical-ness in your life? What technique for this 
    most appealed to you from this program?</LI>
  <LI>What did you think of the man described in the program who said that when 
    he was paralyzed he really began to live? If you were paralyzed, do you think 
    you could ever say this? Why or why not? What does the paralyzed man have 
    that allows him to say that?</LI>
  <LI>Do you have time? What do you spend your time on? How could you make more 
    time for yourself?</LI>
  <LI>What does it mean to live only in the present? Are the past and future unreal? 
    If so, in what ways are they unreal? How do the past and the future separate 
    us from the present? How does this diminish the quality of life?</LI>
  <LI>How many minutes a day do you spend in the past or in the future? How much 
    do you daydream about the past and the future?</LI>
  <LI>Buddha said that enlightenment consists in coming to the present. How would 
    you explain what he said?</LI>
  <LI>What does it mean to be here and to come to our senses? What did Fr. de 
    Mello mean by this?</LI>
  <LI>The story was told during the program of an American soldier in Korea who 
    argued all during a Thanksgiving dinner. Later he realized that he had hardly 
    tasted the meal he had so looked forward to. Can you think of a similar experience 
    that you have had? What is it?</LI>
  <LI>Fr. de Mello said, &quot;Ideas are not life. They are excellent to guide 
    us in life, but they are not life.... Life is found in experience.&quot; Do 
    you agree? Why or why not?</LI>
  <LI>How can ideas be an obstacle to experience? Can you think of an example 
    of this from your own life?</LI>
  <LI>There was a guru who said that as a result of enlightenment when he eats 
    he eats, when he looks he looks, and when he hears he hears. Do you consider 
    this point ironic? Do you think he meant that everyone is enlightened? Why 
    or why not? How would you have reacted to the guru?</LI>
  <LI>Do you consider the exercises in this program to be a form of prayer? Why 
    or why not?</LI>

<H3><B> Exercises for Freedom </B></H3>
<H4>Observe Yourself</H4>
<P> Think of an event in the recent past. Observe yourself reacting to this event. 
  How did you react emotionally? What convictions and attitudes’ were part of 
  your reaction? What inner voice were you responding to? Was someone else reacting 
  for you? Be a neutral observer. Do not judge yourself. Just look. Take your 
  time with this exercise. Your mechanical-ness will stop if you learn to practice 
  this exercise frequently and successfully.</P>
<H4>&nbsp;Experience Reality</H4>
<P>At any time of the day listen to everything around you, look at everything 
  around you, and feel the sensations of your body. This will ground you in the 
  here. Then stay with your senses. Bring your-self to the world of the senses 
  and of experience.</P>
