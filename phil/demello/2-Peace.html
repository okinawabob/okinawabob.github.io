    <h3>
      Discussion Questions
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In this program Fr. deMello talked about spiritual peace. Have you
      experienced this kind of peace? If so, what were the circumstances? How
      has this program changed your ideas about peace? Do you think spiritual
      peace is important? Why or why not? How do you spread peace?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. deMello remarked that the kind of peace he described may not
      exclude fighting. How is this possible? What example can you think of in
      which peace and conflict were both present?
      </li>
      <li>Fr, deMello said the only thing peace excludes is a self-centered
      attitude. Do you agree? How does selfishness lead to the absence of
      peace?
      </li>
      <li>What is soft-heartedness as described by Fr. deMello? What acts of
      soft-heartedness can you think of? Did these acts promote peace? If so.
      how?
      </li>
      <li>Can you say there is no rancor, no bitterness, and no hatred in your
      life? If not, where are these present? How can you do away with them?

      </li>
      <li>In one of the stories told in this program, God's most trusted angels
      advised him to hide in the human heart because no one would think of
      searching for him there. What effect did this story have on you? Do you
      think of God as being in the human heart? What does this mean to you?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. deMello asserted that his body-awareness exercise will help you
      come home to your self. What is your reaction to that? Will you try it
      regularly ? Do you think it can help you? Why or why not?
      </li>
      <li>Fr. deMello said it is an extraordinary thing to come to the present.
      Why is it extraordinary? Do you consider your self present in the way
      that Fr. deMello described it? Explain, using examples.
      </li>
      <li>What is the value of slowing down? When is slowing down necessarily
      opposed to speed?
      </li>
      <li>What is the value of doing one thing at a time? Do you do one thing
      at a time always, sometimes, or never? Explain.

      fighting?
      </li>

      attain the attitude of acceptance and yet to be intensely involved. Do
      you think you can achieve this attitude? To what important things in your
      life would you like to apply this attitude?
      </li>
      <li>When Jesus died he said, "My peace be with you." What is the peace
      that Jesus left with us? How will the exercises in this program help you
