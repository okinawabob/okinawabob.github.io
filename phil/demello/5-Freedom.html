<H2><B>Part 5: Freedom</B></H2>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, 
  good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions 
  for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own importance. 
  Many exercises are described to help people become free of these chains.</P>
<H3>Freedom Exercise</H3>
<P>Meditatively imagine what existed one hundred years ago on the spot where you 
  are now. What existed there three thousand years ago? What will exist there 
  three thousand years from now? You will experience a sense of vastness. You 
  will gain a realization that except in the eyes of God you are not really important. 
  (Allow five to ten minutes for this exercise.)</P>

<H4>Perspective Exercise</H4>
<P>Meditatively imagine what existed one hundred years ago on the spot where you 
  are. What existed there three thousand years ago? What will exist there three 
  thousand years from now?</P>
<P>As a result of this exercise, you will begin to experience a sense of vastness. 
  You will gain a realization that except in the eyes of God you are not important.</P>
<H4>The Mysterious Exercise </H4>
<P>In a meditative environment get in touch with the sensations you experience 
  in your body. After a while, be aware of the one who is observing those sensations 
  and say internally, &quot;I am not those sensations. I am not this body.&quot; 
  Be aware of your thinking and then be aware of the one who is observing the 
  thoughts and say, "I am not my thinking, I am not my thoughts.&quot; Become 
  aware of your feelings or recall some feelings from the recent past. Turn your 
  attention to the one, who is observing those feelings and say, &quot;I am not 
  these feelings. I am not my feelings.&quot; If you are anxious or depressed, 
  do a similar thing by saying, &quot;I am not the anxiety&quot; or &quot;I am 
  not the depression.&quot; This exercise will have a great effect on you hut 
  you may not notice it immediately.</P>
<H4>Remembering Exercise</H4>
<P>In a meditative environment realize that you are being influenced by some bad 
  experience from the past. In a few minutes of peace and quiet go back to that 
  experience and speak to the Lord. Imagine the Lord is next to you. Tell the 
  Lord that if he allowed it to happen, you believe it was for your own good. 
  Thank the Lord for this experience. Do not be violent and do not force yourself. 
  Do not allow your-self to become too immersed in the memory. If this does not 
  work, leave it for another day. Ordinarily the benefits of this exercise are 
  not achieved quickly.</P>
<H4>Good Bye Exercise</H4>
<P>Think of some people you have loved in the past but who are no longer with 
  you. Talk to these people. Say some-thing like, &quot;How lucky I was that you 
  came into my life. How grateful I am to you. I will love you always. And now 
  goodbye. I must go because if I cling to you I will not learn to love the present 
  or the people I am with, so good bye.&quot; Then move to pleasant experiences 
  you have had and personalize them. Repeat the same sequence as above to them. 
  Think of some of your former personal possessions such as your youth or your 
  strength. Personalize them and then repeat the above sequence to them.</P>
<H4>Exercise to Be Free of Fear</H4>
<P>Speak to some fear you have about the future of yours. Then speak to the Lord 
  and thank the Lord in advance for the outcome of the thing you fear.</P>
<H4>Exercise to Be Free of Ambition</H4>
<P>Stand in front of the Lord and make an act of faith to him. Tell him, &quot;Lord, 
  I trust that you are in control of the future. I’m going to do everything in 
  my power to make my dreams come true but I leave the result in your hands.&quot; 
  Then imagine that you let go of your ambition. Thank the Lord in advance for 
  the outcome.</P>
<H4>Exercise to Be Free of Possessiveness</H4>
<P>In a meditative environment think of someone you are possessive of. In your 
  imagination talk to that person. Talk lovingly. Tell the person what he or she 
  means to you and then add, &quot;How -precious you are to me, how dear and how 
  lovely. But you are not my life. I have a life to live, a destiny to fulfill 
  that is separate from you.&quot;</P>
<P>Take things and places that are dear to you and repeat the same thing -to each 
  of them. Repeat the same sequence to the things that are the most intimate to 
  you, such as your reputation, or your health, or your life itself. If this is 
  too painful for you, leave it for another time.</P>
